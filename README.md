2. Navigate with the arrows, Up, Left, Right and Down on your keyboard as your character to make the red dragon fly through a field of enemy blue dragons. If it touches the blue dragon, game over.

3. Eat stars to get a high score by moving towards them. Each star increases layer score by 25 points. When you finish eating all the stars, more stars appear.
